# EFL Electricity Plan Comparator

Fetches all fixed-rate Oncor electricity plans from [powertochoose.org](https://powertochoose.org), downloads and parses each provider's Electricity Facts Label (EFL), and produces an interactive HTML comparison table showing **actual bill costs at your real usage levels** — not just the standard 500/1,000/2,000 kWh tiers disclosed on the EFL.

Configured for the **Oncor service area**. Set your zip code via `--zip` or the `EFL_ZIP` environment variable.

---

## What It Does

1. **Fetches plans** from powertochoose.org via CSV export — all Oncor fixed-rate English plans (TimeOfUse and prepaid excluded). Optionally merge in or replace this with your own locally-supplied EFLs — see [Manual EFLs](#manual-efls) below.
2. **Downloads EFL PDFs** in parallel (10 at a time), cached locally with HTTP HEAD freshness checking
3. **Parses rate components** from each EFL using PyMuPDF with spatial text sorting:
   - Regex extraction for energy charge, base charge, and bill credits
   - Local LLM (Qwen2.5-7B) for structural analysis: threshold energy charges, tiered rates, bundled TDU, amortised fees
   - 2-attempt download retry (45s + 30s) before Playwright browser fallback
4. **Cross-checks bill credits** between the EFL and PUCT's CSV data using the LLM; escalates disagreements to EFL re-parse
5. **Calculates effective rates** at the standard EFL tiers (500/1,000/2,000 kWh) plus any personal profile tiers you configure via `EFL_TIERS` or `--tiers`
6. **Generates an interactive HTML table** (`plans_latest.html`) with:
   - **Dark/light theme toggle** (defaults to dark)
   - **Top 3 Picks cards** — best plan from each of the 3 cheapest term groups, shown above the table
   - Plans grouped by contract term (longest first), collapsible
   - ▼/★/▶ group header cycles: all plans → best only → hidden
   - ❤ favorite toggle per row
   - ★ marks cheapest plan in each group
   - Color-coded source badges: `[EFL]` green / `[LLM]` amber / `[API]` red
   - ¢ badge for bill-credit plans (advertised rate only valid near credit threshold)
   - ℹ badge with fee/credit details on hover
   - ⚠ badge for plans with one-time setup fees
   - `M` badge (violet) for manually-supplied EFLs — not fetched from or verified against powertochoose.org
   - **vs best longer column** — color-coded delta (green/amber/red) at your compare tier, with styled hover tooltip showing which plan is being compared and its rate
   - Plan name links open the EFL PDF in a new tab

---

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10+** (tested on 3.12)
- **Windows 10+** with NVIDIA GPU recommended (RTX 3060 12 GB or similar)
- **Internet access** for plan fetching and EFL downloads
- ~**5 GB disk space** for the LLM model

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone / copy the script files

Place `efl_compare.py`, `credit_parser.py`, and `requirements.txt` in the same directory.

### 2. Install Python dependencies

```
py -3.12 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Install llama-cpp-python

**GPU (recommended — NVIDIA CUDA 12.x):**
```
py -3.12 -m pip install llama-cpp-python --extra-index-url https://abetlen.github.io/llama-cpp-python/whl/cu124
```

**CPU only:**
```
py -3.12 -m pip install llama-cpp-python
```

> The script auto-detects GPU presence at runtime via `nvidia-smi`. If you install the GPU build on a CPU-only machine it falls back gracefully.

### 4. Install Playwright browser (one-time, ~300 MB)

```
py -3.12 -m playwright install chromium
```

Enables fetching EFLs from providers that use JavaScript-rendered pages (Octopus Energy, TriEagle).

### 5. First run — model download (~4.7 GB, one-time)

On the first run that triggers LLM parsing, the script automatically downloads `Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf` into a `models/` subdirectory. No action needed — it shows a progress bar.

## Usage

```
py -3.12 efl_compare.py --zip ZIP [options]
```

ZIP code and personal tiers can be set via environment variables so you don't have to pass them on every run:

```
# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:EFL_ZIP = "YOUR_ZIP"
$env:EFL_TIERS = "LOW,MID,HIGH"
py -3.12 efl_compare.py

# macOS / Linux
EFL_ZIP=YOUR_ZIP EFL_TIERS=LOW,MID,HIGH py3 efl_compare.py
```

## Manual EFLs

Not every plan a REP offers is listed on powertochoose.org — retention or renewal offers given directly to an existing customer (e.g. over the phone) commonly aren't. `--manual-efl` / `--manual-efl-dir` let you drop a local EFL PDF into the comparison so it's ranked alongside everything else, without needing it to be on PUCT at all.

Texas EFLs are a state-mandated standardized disclosure (16 TAC §25.475), so a locally-supplied PDF carries everything a PUCT CSV row would otherwise provide: REP/product name, contract term, early termination fee, renewable content %, and the 500/1,000/2,000 kWh average-price table. The script extracts these directly from the EFL text — no PUCT lookup needed.

Header layout isn't fully standardized across REPs, though, so extraction is best-effort per field. If a field can't be found, the plan is still included with a placeholder (filename for REP/product, `0` for term, `Unknown` for the termination fee, `?` for renewable %) and a printed `[MANUAL EFL]` warning naming exactly what wasn't found — but the **rate itself is never guessed**. If the actual energy charge and credit structure can't be determined from the EFL text at all, that plan is excluded from the results with a loud warning telling you to check the PDF, rather than shown with a fabricated number.

Manually-supplied plans are parsed directly from disk and skip the PUCT download/cache-freshness machinery entirely. They're marked with a violet `M` badge in the Flags column so they're never mistaken for a PUCT-verified plan.

## Understanding the Output

### HTML Table

Open `plans_latest.html` in any browser. Fully self-contained — no external dependencies.

**Theme:** Defaults to dark mode. Click the **☀ Light** button (top right, scrolls with page) to toggle.

**Top Picks cards:** Three cards above the table show the cheapest plan from each of the top 3 term groups at your compare tier.

**Group header controls:**
- Click a group header to cycle: ▼ (all plans) → ★ (best + favorites) → ▶ (hidden) → ▼
- Click the ▼ in the top-left header cell to apply the same state to all groups

**Row badges (Flags column, hover for details):**
- `[EFL]` — rates from the legal EFL document (most accurate)
- `[LLM]` — rates extracted by local AI from the EFL text (high accuracy)
- `[API]` — rates estimated from PUCT CSV price data (least accurate)
- `¢` — bill-credit plan: advertised rate only valid near the credit threshold kWh
- `ℹ` — hover to see the fee/credit description from PUCT's data
- `⚠ $X` — one-time setup fee (not included in the displayed rates)
- `M` — manually-supplied EFL (see [Manual EFLs](#manual-efls)) — not fetched from or verified against powertochoose.org

**vs best longer column:** Color-coded rate delta vs the best plan with a strictly longer contract, at your compare tier. Hover anywhere in the cell for a styled tooltip showing which plan is being compared and its rate. Green = small delta (<1¢), amber = moderate (1–3¢), red = large (>3¢).

### Run Stats

At the end of every run:
```
------------------------------------------------------------
  Wall clock:    152s
  Plans:         129 results  |  0 API fallback  |  20 LLM fallback
  EFL cache:     129 PDF  +  5 HTML files
  LLM calls:     34  |  prompt 62,000 tok  |  completion 1,946 tok
  Model load:    3.8s
  Prompt eval:   27.9s  (1,668 tok/s)
  Generation:    42.0s  (58 tok/s)
------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Golden File & Testing Tools

> **Note:** The `_golden/` folder is a **development and validation system** — it is not required to run the comparator. You can use `efl_compare.py` normally without it. The golden system is useful if you want to verify output accuracy, contribute improvements, or rebuild ground-truth data for a different zip code or service area.

A **golden file** (`_golden/golden_plans.json`) contains ground-truth rate extraction for a set of Oncor plans, built via a 3-agent adversarial Claude pipeline and reviewed by a human for edge cases. It serves as the reference standard for regression testing. The golden file is not included in the repo — build your own with `golden_build_adversarial.js` for your zip code and service area.

**`_golden/golden_compare.py`** — compares script JSON output against the golden file:
```
py -3.12 _golden/golden_compare.py [plans_latest.json] [--tiers A,B,...] [--compare-tier N]
```
Reads `EFL_TIERS` and `EFL_COMPARE_TIER` env vars as defaults (same convention as the main script).

**`_golden/golden_review.py`** — records human review overrides on individual golden entries:
```
py -3.12 _golden/golden_review.py <pid> [--energy_charge_cents 7.3] [--notes "reason"]
```

**`_golden/golden_build_adversarial.js`** — rebuilds the golden file from scratch using Claude's API (requires Claude Code with workflow support).

## Cache and Data Files

| File/Dir | Description |
|---|---|
| `plans_latest.csv` | Last CSV download from powertochoose.org |
| `plans_latest.html` | Last generated comparison table |
| `plans_latest.json` | Last full JSON output (rates, credits, flags per plan) |
| `_golden/` | Golden system: ground-truth file, backups, build pipeline, compare and review scripts |
| `_golden/golden_plans.json` | Ground-truth rate extraction for all 129 plans |
| `_golden/golden_plans.backup_YYYYMMDD.json` | Dated in-project backup |
| `efls_cache/` | Cached EFL PDFs and HTML files |
| `efls_cache/cache_meta.json` | Per-plan metadata: URL, ETag, Last-Modified, timestamp |
| `models/` | Downloaded LLM model (~4.7 GB) |
| `_dev/` | Development and testing tools: LLM test harnesses, PDF parser tests |

The `efls_cache/` directory is pruned automatically — EFLs for plans no longer in the PUCT CSV are deleted each run.

---

## Known Limitations

- **TriEagle Energy LP** — uses EFL URLs that occasionally time out; Playwright browser fallback handles most cases. Rates may fall back to CSV estimate on slow server days.
- **Tara Energy / Amigo Energy** — EFL servers use legacy TLS renegotiation; the script retries automatically with a compatibility SSL context.
- **Some providers** host EFLs behind JavaScript (Octopus Energy, Chariot Energy) — Playwright handles these; intermittent server slowness can cause API fallback.
- Spanish-language plan listings are excluded (English only).

---

## Architecture Notes

- EFL downloads run **in parallel** (10 workers); LLM calls are **serial** (GPU singleton)
- **PUCT Rule §25.475**: EFL Electricity Price section stated rates are authoritative over CSV data and three-tier average prices. The script and golden file both enforce this hierarchy.
- Bill credit reconciliation: EFL regex → cross-check vs PUCT CSV via LLM → escalate to LLM EFL re-parse on disagreement
- Structural LLM guards: impossible states (tier boundary with zero above-tier rate; energy threshold on bill-credit plans) are caught, corrected, and flagged as `[LLM BUG]` warnings
- TDU rates fetched from `puc.texas.gov` each run; falls back to most recent local EFL, then hardcoded constants
- The LLM auto-detects GPU via `nvidia-smi`; falls back to CPU if unavailable
- `aria-hidden="true"` on the HTML table prevents accessibility tree rebuild on row toggle (~670ms UI lag eliminated)
