efl_compare.py -- Compare Oncor fixed electricity plans from powertochoose.org

Usage:
    py -3.12 efl_compare.py --zip ZIP [--tiers A,B,...] [--text-table]
                            [--json] [--timestamped] [--no-llm] [--clear-cache]

    ZIP code and personal tiers can also be set via environment variables:
        EFL_ZIP=YOUR_ZIP EFL_TIERS=LOW,MID,HIGH py -3.12 efl_compare.py

Requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt

================================================================================
HOW IT WORKS
================================================================================

PLAN DATA
    powertochoose.org is operated by the PUCT (Public Utility Commission of
    Texas) and is the only site where all certified REPs are required to list
    their plans. Plan data is fetched via a POST to /en-us/Plan/ExportToCsv,
    which returns a structured CSV with pricing, EFL URLs, and metadata.
    The full CSV is saved to plans_latest.csv each run for debugging.

TDU RATES
    Oncor delivery charges (fixed $/mo + per-kWh) are the same for every
    provider and are passed through without markup. The script fetches current
    rates from the PUCT website (puc.texas.gov/industry/electric/rates/tdr/).
    Fallback chain: PUCT HTML scrape -> most recently dated local EFL that
    includes TDU charges -> hardcoded constants (June 2026 values).

USAGE TIERS
    EFLs only disclose pricing at 500/1000/2000 kWh -- insufficient for
    households with usage well above or below those tiers. The script calculates
    effective rates at the standard EFL tiers plus any personal tiers configured
    via EFL_TIERS or --tiers. The compare tier (default: median of personal tiers)
    is the primary sort key and the basis for the "vs best longer" delta.

EFL PARSING
    For each plan, the script downloads the EFL PDF (cached in efls_cache/) and
    extracts the energy charge and base charge using regex against PyMuPDF text
    (sort=True for spatial ordering). The Electricity Price section is anchored
    at "Average Monthly Use" rather than the section label, capturing rate rows
    that precede the label in multi-column PDF layouts. TDU charges are applied
    from the PUCT source above so all plans share the same current delivery rates
    regardless of when their EFL was published.

    Downloads use a 2-attempt strategy (45s + 30s timeout), followed by a
    Playwright headless-browser fallback (also 2 attempts) for JavaScript-rendered
    pages (Octopus Energy, TriEagle, Chariot Energy). If all attempts fail, rates
    fall back to CSV back-calculation.

BILL CREDITS
    Bill-credit plans advertise a low ¢/kWh rate that only applies at a
    specific usage threshold (typically 1000 kWh exactly). At typical high-usage
    levels well above the threshold, these plans are significantly more expensive.
    The script uses the full credit structure to calculate accurate rates at all
    six tiers.

    Credit data comes from two sources that are cross-checked against each
    other, since [Fees/Credits] in the CSV is a PUCT-validated structured field
    while the EFL is the legally authoritative document:

    1. EFL PDF (regex)  -- fast, direct from the legal document
    2. CSV [Fees/Credits] (LLM) -- PUCT-validated, always present, machine-
                                    readable; parsed by Qwen2.5-7B on GPU

    Reconciliation logic (for plans where has_crd=True):
      a. EFL parsed OK + both sources agree -> use agreed credits, high confidence
      b. EFL parsed OK + sources disagree   -> LLM re-parses the EFL text
                                               (applying careful LLM reading to
                                               the legal document), uses that
                                               result, flags a warning to user
      c. EFL parse failed                   -> CSV [Fees/Credits] via LLM only,
                                               back-calculate energy charge from
                                               the API's tier price + credit amount

    For plans where EFL parse failed, base_charge is assumed $0. Bill-credit
    plans almost universally use $0 base charge (the credit is the pricing
    mechanism), so this assumption is safe for this plan type.

    The [Fees/Credits] LLM parser caches results in memory -- at most 22 unique
    strings exist across the full CSV, so the model is called at most 22 times
    per run regardless of plan count.

SORTING AND OUTPUT
    Plans are grouped by contract term, longest first. Within each group, sorted
    by effective rate at the compare tier (default: median of --tiers).
    The rightmost column shows the delta vs the best plan with a
    strictly longer contract -- color-coded green/amber/red with a hover tooltip
    showing which plan and rate is being compared against.

    Output files are always written as plans_latest.html / .json. Pass
    --timestamped to also save a dated copy (e.g. plans_20260619_143022.html)
    alongside the latest file.

    The HTML output (plans_latest.html) includes:
      - Dark/light theme toggle (defaults to dark)
      - Top 3 Picks summary cards above the table
      - Collapsible term groups (▼ all / ★ best / ▶ hidden)
      - ❤ per-row favorite toggle
      - Color-coded source badges: [EFL] / [LLM] / [API]
      - ¢ badge for bill-credit plans (rate only valid near credit threshold)
      - ℹ badge with fee/credit details on hover
      - ⚠ badge for plans with one-time setup fees

    LLM STRUCTURAL GUARDS
    The structural LLM can misidentify bill-credit kWh thresholds as energy
    charge tier boundaries. Three guards catch and correct impossible states,
    emitting [LLM BUG] warnings to stdout:
      - tier_boundary_kwh AND energy_charge_threshold_kwh both set -> zero threshold
      - energy_charge_threshold_kwh set on a bill-credit plan -> zero threshold
      - tier_boundary_kwh > 0 with ec_above_tier == 0 (free energy above boundary,
        commercially impossible) -> zero tier boundary
